In particular, 1) any operation on tensors can take advantage of the parallel computation capabilities of graphical processing units (GPU), and 2) the backward pass can be automatically obtained by asking PyTorch to construct the computational graph and use automatic built-in backpropagation algorithms (also known as [_Autograd_](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html)  or automatic differentiation algorithms). \n",

    "* `dtype`: the data type to be used for the tensor. Although this is usually derived automatically from `data`, it is good to set it specifically if we want to ensure it and the way we initialize it leaves room for doubt. For example, here we are initializing variables that we want to represent as double-precision floating-point numbers (`torch.float64`) with integer values.\n",

The `nn` package defines a set of `Modules`, which are roughly equivalent to neural network layers. A `Module` receives input Tensors and computes output Tensors, but may also hold an internal state such as Tensors containing learnable parameters. The nn package also defines a set of useful [loss functions](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#loss-functions) and [activation functions](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#non-linear-activations-weighted-sum-nonlinearity) that are commonly used when training neural networks.\n",

The [Sigmoid module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Sigmoid.html#torch.nn.Sigmoid) applies the sigmoid function to the output of the previous Linear module.
