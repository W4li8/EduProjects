For that, we will leave the real images for a moment and use a toy example, the [Shepp-Logan phantom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepp%E2%80%93Logan_phantom), a standard test for image reconstruction algorithms coming from the field of computerized tomography (CT). We will load this image from skimage's [data](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.data.html) module. It has a range of $[0, 1]$, and we will add zero-mean gaussian noise with a standard deviation of $0.2$ (comparably, quite a lot of noise). Then we will denoise with a series of thresholds, and plot the evolution of the SNRs with the threshold. \n",

    "As you saw towards the end of [Lab 1](./1_Wavelet_transform.ipynb), just a few coefficients of the wavelet transform can rebuild an image with a decent SNR. This makes a the wavelet transform a great tool for image compression. Simple data compression is achieved by applying a hard threshold to the coefficients of an image transform, as used in JPEG2000 with the wavelet transform or in JPEG with the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Note that this is only a rudimentary form of compression. A true encoder would further quantize the wavelet coefficients, which induces additional errors. The resulting coefficient map would also need to be encoded efficiently using, for example, the EZW algorithm (embedded zero-tree wavelet coding). You can find more information about the EZW algorithm on your [course-notes](https://moodle.epfl.ch/course/view.php?id=463), or if you are really interested in the topic, read [the original article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/258085).\n",
